                <p>During school, a student getting taught new subjects can be confusing.</p>

                <p>Now the girl is confused and questioning where she fits in her roles, but it goes against what she
                    believed as an individual.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When she goes home, she tells her parents of what she learning. They become upset, especially over
                    the lack of control over her education despite their parental rights. </p>

                <p> Resulting in the new Executive Order, with the intention of ending radical indoctrination, </p>

                <p>That is Executive Order #14190</p>

            <h2>Information</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>This Executive Order was made to take control over radical subjects being taught in school.</p>
                <div class="parallax4">
                </div>
                <p>With many specific goals in mind, that came in the process of eliminating the indoctrination.</p>
                <div class="parallax5">
                </div>
                <p>The plans were two different paths of action. One, to have General/State attorney generals formulate
                    a plan to monitor curriculum and two, to continue the federal fund freeze.</p>
                <div class="parallax6">
                </div>
                <p>People who agreed with the Executive Order believed that it would stop the insistent division,
                    confusion, and distrust that came with the new topic.</p>
                <div class="parallax7">
                </div>
                <p>People who disagreed with the Executive Order believed that having those new subjects implemented
                    into the learning environment meant creating an open and educated community. </p>
                <div class="parallax8">
                </div>
                <p>However, surveys and data found that teachers and adults alike desired subjects of race to be
                    involved in education, but subjects of gender and sexual orientation to be outside of school.</p>
                <div class="parallax9">

                <p>Thank you for listening.</p>
